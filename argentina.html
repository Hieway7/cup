In 18 World Cup tournaments, Argentina had 48 victories in 84 matches. The team was present in all but four of the World Cups, being behind only Brazil and Germany in number of appearances (with the 2022 edition included, being played).

        Argentina has also won the Copa Am√©rica 15 times, the highest amount, tied with Uruguay. Moreover, Argentina has also won the Confederations Cup and the gold medal at the 2004 and 2008 Olympic football tournaments. Prior to that, Argentina won two silver medals in the 1928 and 1996 editions. On other levels of international competition, Argentina has won the U-20 World Cup six times.
